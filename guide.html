    </ol>
    Before diving into the gameplay, let us understand the equipment and court layout in badminton.
</p> -->
<ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>Racket</strong>: <a href="https://www.decathlon.in/search?query=Badminton%20Racket?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=decathlon_blog&amp;utm_campaign=how-to-play-badminton-for-beginners-mastering-the-basics">Badminton rackets</a> are lightweight and typically made of materials such as carbon fiber or aluminum.

It is designed to provide stability and proper aerodynamics during gameplay.</li><li><strong>Indoor Court: </strong>Badminton is commonly played indoors due to its susceptibility to wind. The court is rectangular and divided into two halves by a net. It is essential to have adequate lighting and sufficient space to move around freely.</li></ol>
<h3><strong>Court Layout</strong></h3>
<ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>Singles Court</strong>: The singles court is narrower compared to the doubles court. The boundary lines mark the different areas of the court, such as the back boundary lines, sidelines, and centerline.</li><li><strong>Doubles Court:</strong> The doubles court is wider to accommodate two players on each side. The additional boundary lines for doubles play are the long service lines and the wider back boundary lines.</li></ol>
<h2>Essential Badminton Techniques for Holding the Racket</h2>
<ol start="" role="list"><li>Forehand Grip: The forehand grip is the most commonly used grip in badminton. It provides versatility and allows for effective shots both at the front and back of the court. To achieve the forehand grip, follow these steps:</li></ol><ul role="list"><li>Hold the racket handle as if you are shaking hands with it.</li><li>Place your thumb against the wider flat surface of the racket handle.</li><li>Wrap your fingers around the handle, ensuring a firm but not overly tight grip.</li><li>The racket face should be perpendicular to the ground, allowing you to strike the shuttlecock effectively.</li></ul>
<ol start="2" role="list"><li><strong>Backhand Grip</strong>: Mastering the backhand grip is essential for executing powerful and accurate shots. Follow these steps to achieve the backhand grip:</li></ol>
<ul role="list"><li>Start with the forehand grip as a foundation.</li><li>Gradually move your hand down the handle, reaching towards the end.</li><li>Turn your wrist anticlockwise for right-handed players or clockwise for left-handed players to make a minor alteration.</li><li>The back of your hand should face the net, allowing you to generate power and control during backhand shots.</li></ul>
<ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong>Serve Grip</strong>: The serve grip is crucial for delivering accurate and controlled serves. Follow these steps to achieve the optimal serve grip:</li></ol>
<ul role="list"><li>Hold the racket handle with a relaxed grip.</li><li>Place your fingers slightly apart, allowing flexibility and control.</li><li>Keep your thumb relaxed and alongside the handle.</li><li>The racket face should be angled slightly downward, enabling a smooth and controlled serve.</li><li>The racket face should be angled slightly downward, enabling a smooth and controlled serve.</li></ul>
           
<h3>
    Badminton Serving Strategies
</h3>
<p>
    The serve is a crucial aspect of badminton, as it determines the beginning of each rally and offers an opportunity to gain an advantage over your opponent. Implementing effective serving strategies can put pressure on your opponent and set the tone for the game. Here are some key serving strategies to consider:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Short Serve: The short serve is executed by hitting the shuttlecock in such a way that it falls closer to the net on the opponent's side. This type of serve aims to limit the opponent's options and create an opportunity for an attacking shot.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Stand close to the front boundary line of your side of the court.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a gentle flick of the wrist to hit the shuttlecock over the net with a shallow trajectory.
        </li>
        <li>
            Aim to make the shuttlecock land in the front mid-court area of your opponent's side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow up with a quick follow-up shot to take control of the rally.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Long Serve: The long serve is aimed at pushing your opponent towards the back boundary line and gaining a positional advantage. It requires a greater amount of power and accuracy.
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Stand closer to the back boundary line of your side of the court.
        </li>
        <li>
            Utilize a stronger swing and hit the shuttlecock with a higher trajectory to clear the net and reach the back of your opponent's court.
        </li>
        <li>
            Aim for the farthest area from your opponent, near the back boundary line.
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow up with a defensive position to counter your opponent's return shot.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
        Flick Serve: The flick serve is a deceptive technique that surprises your opponent by making them believe you're performing a short serve when, in fact, you execute a long serve.
    </li>
    <ul role="list"><li>Begin with a similar motion as the short serve.</li><li>Use a sudden acceleration of your wrist to hit the shuttlecock with more power, causing it to travel deeper into your opponent's court.</li><li>Aim for the backcourt area, close to the boundary line.</li><li>Maintain a neutral stance to be ready for your opponent's response.</li></ul>
</ol>
<h3>
    Badminton Rules, Scoring, and Fouls
</h3>
<p>
    Let's explore the key aspects:
</p>

<ol start="" role="list"><li><strong>Scoring System</strong>: Badminton follows a rally-point scoring system, meaning a point is scored on every rally, regardless of which player served. The standard scoring system is as follows:</li></ol>

<ul role="list"><li>Each game is played to 21 points.</li><li>The player or team who reaches 21 points first, with a minimum two-point lead, wins the game.</li><li>When the score becomes level at 20-20, the competition continues until a player establishes a two-point lead, for instance, 22-20 or 23-21.</li><li>A match typically consists of the best of three games.</li></ul>
<ol start="2" role="list"><li><strong>Service Rules</strong>: Proper serving is essential in badminton to ensure fair play and equal opportunities for both players. Here are some key service rules to keep in mind:</li></ol>
<ul role="list"><li>The server must stand within the service court diagonally opposite to the receiver.</li><li>The shuttlecock must be hit below the server's waist level.</li><li>The server's racket should make contact with the shuttlecock below the server's waist.</li></ul>
<ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong>Faults and Fouls</strong>: Certain actions or violations can result in faults or fouls. Here are some common ones to avoid:</li></ol>
<ul role="list"><li>Hitting the shuttlecock outside the boundaries of the court.</li><li>Failing to return the shuttlecock before it hits the ground.</li><li>Touching the net with the racket or body during play.</li><li>Obstructing your opponent's shot or movement.</li></ul>
<p>

              <p class="text-justify">
                Badminton is a recreational and competitive game played in singles (two opposing players) and doubles (two opposing pairs) formats. The aim of the game is to win points by hitting a shuttlecock across the net and into your opponent's court forcing your opponent to make an error and be unable to return the shuttlecock back. The lightness of the racket and the shape of the shuttlecock mean that it is a very fast game requiring good reactions and speed around the court.
